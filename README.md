**When you shake your spear, beware you don't fall on your staff.** ---- *Falstaff's Last Laugh (or, a fable of the false ass [status: tabled] )*

My name's Jason. I write stuff that's not software. What little code I scrape together is embarrassingly unfit for public consumption. That's not why I'm here. 

As someone who uses opens source software almost exclusively, I end up in this place multiple times a day reading up on things and checking out new projects. So I thought it was high time I create an account, if only to give some stars and show some support.

My primary personal interest is spec fic in general, horror in particular; my education is in literature and creative writing; and my professional experience is mostly in copy writing (with a focus on tech) and technical writing (with a focus on documentation and other material for end users.)

I'm looking for projects to contribute to, so feel free to reach out if you're working on anything that could use some quality writing.
